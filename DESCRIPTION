Description: Provide functions for performing abundance and compositional based 
    binning on metagenomic samples, directly from FASTA or FASTQ files.
    Functions are implemented in Java and called via rJava.
    Parallel implementation that operates directly on input FASTA/FASTQ files 
    for fast execution.
